# AI Video Recommendation System



This is a toy implementation of an AI generated video reccomendation system, the videos were pregenerated by open sora.
The engine uses 512 dimension vectors to calculate user and video embeddings. takes interactions like watch time, likes and comments to update the user embedding while the user scrolls.

## Features

* **Video Embedding Generation:** Extracts features from video frames using a pre-trained ResNet model to create video embeddings.
* **User Embedding Update:** Updates user embeddings based on video interactions (likes, comments, watch time).
* **Recommendation Engine:** Recommends videos based on cosine similarity between user and video embeddings.
* **Watched Video Tracking:** Prevents recommending the same video repeatedly to a user.
* **Flask API:** Provides endpoints for video recommendations and interaction updates.
